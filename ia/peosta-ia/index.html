            <h3>Peosta, IA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Peosta is a city in Dubuque County, Iowa, United States, and an exurb of the city of Dubuque. It is part of the Dubuque, Iowa Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,908 in the 2020 census, an increase of 193% from 651 in 2000. Peosta experienced a 70% increase in population (estimated) from 2000 to 2007, making it the state's 10th fastest-growing city during that period. Peosta is currently the sixth-largest city in Dubuque County, but it will likely soon pass Epworth (pop. 1,860) to become the fifth-largest. The community is home to the 2015 ASA D Northern Nationals Men's Slow Pitch Champions, Kass & Company, a large industrial park, the largest campus of Northeast Iowa Community College, and a handful of new commercial businesses. However, the city is increasingly becoming a bedroom community, much like nearby Asbury, made up of suburban subdivisions.</p>
